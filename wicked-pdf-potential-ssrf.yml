      WickedPdf renders page content on the server by saving HTML and assets
      to temporary files on disk, then executing wkhtmltopdf to convert that
      HTML to a PDF file.

      If you incorporate user-defined content into the HTML to be converted to
      PDF, it is highly recommended that you sanitize it first. Malicious
      content could be used to make server-side requests and expose sensitive
      data.
